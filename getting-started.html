        <h2>How to get started?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with
          <a href="index.html">bouldering is surprisingly simple</a>. All you
          need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms
          even rent the equipment for your first sessions. No prior experience
          or complex gear required!
        </p>
